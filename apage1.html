<h1>Internet And Website Development</h1>
<h2>Introduction to the World Wide Web</h2>
<h3><b><u>How the web works</u></b></h3>

<p>The world wide web is an information system on the internet, that is used while web browsing on a device. This system includes things like websites, files and all web-resources. We access the World Wide Web on a daily basis for all sorts of information via the internet. To use the world wide web, we don't need to know how to use coding systems, we just need to have the basic knowledge of what we are looking for and type it up on a web browser, shaping a pathway to the information we are looking for. The information is also accessible by entering a URL, a direct link to the website on the web or even a hyperlink.  Think of it as a large server, where anyone can share information and retrieve information, using the internet. </p>

<p>The world wide web was invented in 1988 by Tim Berners Lee, an English scientist. The way to recognise if something is inside the web is if it starts with  www. For example in the website www.google.com. we know that it is inside the world wide web as it starts with www.</p>

<h3><b><u>Role of Web Servers</u></b></h3>

<p>Web servers are a piece of software on every local computer. Web servers are servers where websites are uploaded. Web servers transfer raw materials (text, images, etc) and transfer to a web page, accessible by anyone accessing the world wide web. Whenever we type in a url in our web browser, it automatically gets transferred to a web server, which takes the request, processes it and sends it back to our computer where we can access the website. To publish a website you need to upload it onto a web server, a place where viewers can access it. Every large company has its own web server. For example, Microsoft has its own web server is called Internet Information Services (IIS).</p>

<h3><b><u>Web Browsers</u></b></h3>

<p>A web browser is an application used to access the world wide web. The browser transfers web page data from the web servers to the web page and vice-versa. Web browsers are means of accessing web pages. All operating systems come with their own version of web browsers. For e.g. Apple operating systems come with a default Safari browser. Microsoft uses Microsoft Edge as their default browser. While on most phones with Android systems, Chrome is the web browser used.
 </p>

<h2>World Wide Web vs Internet</h2>
<h3><b><u>The Internet</u></b></h3>

<p>The invention of the internet revolutionised the technological world and now, in the modern world, we are heavily dependant on the internet on a daily basis. The internet is a network that connects technological devices from all over the world. Through the internet, we can access the world wide web, as mentioned before where we can access and share web resources. The internet is not controlled by anyone and everyone has access to it.</p>  

<h3><b><u>The difference between the Internet and WWW</u></b></h3>

<p>The internet and the world wide web are often said as the same, but they are not. The internet is the network connection of millions of computers worldwide, while the world wide web is the way we can access, share and receive information. To use the world wide web, we need the internet connection and without the internet, the world wide web would not operate. However the internet would still operate without the world wide web, it just would not be as useful. Think of the internet as a hotel, with elevators, stairs and pathways, where all the rooms and services are the web. The world wide web also uses the TCP protocol, whereas the internet can either use the same thing (TCP) or can also use the UDP protocol.</p>

<h2>Intranet and Relation to Internet</h2>
<h3><b><u>What is an intranet?</u></b></h3>

<p>An intranet is a private internet network that only authorised people can have access to. It can be used to share, access and receive web resources just like the internet. A common example of an intranet is the DOE portal, an education intranet. This private portal is only accessible to school students and staff and has restricted content and permissions. An intranet often keeps its content secure as only authorised members can access, and therefore is commonly used in companies, governmental organisations, and educational institutions.</p>

<h3><b><u>Internet and Intranet Connections</u></b></h3>

<p>The internet is a world wide network that connects all computers around the world. Documents, files and web resources can be viewed and shared by anyone and all computers can access. An intranet is also a network that connects computers and where people can share and view web resources. However, only authorised members have access to the intranet and only authorised members can access the information on their intranets.</p><p> Intranets generally have information that is classified and cannot be leaked, and to allow employees/members to access, they add it to a network where only they can see and edit. Think of it as a friends group chat, where only exclusive people are added, as strangers donâ€™t need to be in that environment.  Intranets are often less flashy and exciting as public things on the internet as they do not require to be visually appealing as only seen from the private organisation, not from the customers. The intranet also cannot access all files that you can see from the regular internet, as some might be restricted as irrelevant.</p> <p>In our example of DOE portal, content that is meant only for students and teachers is published on the intranet, whereas information that is meant to be available to general public is published on the DOE internet website. </p>

<h2>Internet Protocol (HTTP, TCP/IP and FTP)  </h2>
<h3><b><u>Internet Protocol</u></b></h3>

<p>Internet protocol is a certain set of rules or standards used to transfer data on the internet. There are many protocols but the most common two are HTTP and FTP, which both use TCP/IP as the underlying mechanism for data transfer.</p>

<h3><b><u>TCP/IP</u></b></h3>

<p>Tcp/IP is the inner-protocol that both HTTP and FTP use for data connections and management. The TCP part makes sure that all the data is in the correct order and that none of it is missing. It also maintains routing, to make sure the data is sent in the most efficient way possible in the circumstance the internet is slow. The IP part ensures that the routing is accurate. When the data transfer is in the form of a large file, TCP/IP makes sure that it is evenly distributed and sends it through the network.</p>

<h3><b><u>HTTP</u></b></h3>

<p>Http stands for hypertext transfer protocol and is the most efficient method of transferring smaller amounts of data. It is the protocol used by web pages. It is the method which web browsers use to communicate with web servers and underpins the communication of the world wide web. HTTPS is a secure http protocol where information sent is <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/encryption#:~:text=Encryption%20is%20the%20method%20by,encrypted%20data%20is%20called%20ciphertext" >encrypted</a>. Personal and financial data transfer should always be made over HTTPS as it is secure and encrypted. HTTP does not authenticate the connection and therefore can undertake multiple sessions simultaneously. </p>

<h3><b><u>FTP</u></b></h3>

<p>FTP stands for File transfer protocol and is the most efficient method of transferring large files of data over the network. FTP is only used to transfer data in a file-format and cannot be used for data transfer from web page to web server.  FTP uses 2 TCP/IP connections, control connection and data connection. Control connection authenticates the user while data connection transmits data files. FTP can only maintain a limited number of sessions at a time. SFTP is secure FTP and is more secure as it transfers encrypted data.</p>
